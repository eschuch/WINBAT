# WINBAT
Windows CMD batch files helper. Do something with nothing
I try to make simple bat files that uses only windows cmd. From Win XP to Win 10, all should work the same.
Becouse some times we can't use any other program to do that.


+ [BAT_HTML_DOWNLOAD.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eschuch/WINBAT/master/BAT_HTML_DOWNLOAD.bat) -> bugged but simpler BAT file to download html. Using [bitsadmin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bits/bitsadmin-tool)
+ [BAT_NSLOOKUP.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eschuch/WINBAT/master/BAT_NSLOOKUP.bat) -> try to return some errorlevel from nslookup. [Just because MS donÂ´t put it at](http://www.edugeek.net/forums/scripts/102506-how-do-i-put-nslookup-exit-status-into-variable-delprof2-exe-script.html)
+ [BAT_PING.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eschuch/WINBAT/master/BAT_PING.bat) -> Return ERROR 1 if any ping fail, network fail, someone umplug the modem from energy or any thing. BUT it parse the FAIL result. Read the file please before use other language OS.
